<p><strong>Duke Simon Arden</strong> and his bride-to-be, a simple peasant girl named <strong>Beatrice</strong>, had recently returned from their engagement tour of the countryside. Their wedding was rudely interrupted by the banished 'hero' <strong>Ross</strong>, last seen crashing Simon and Beatrice's engagement feast at the 2013 Madrigal.</p>

<p>Ross lost many followers in the ensuing match of combat chess. Ross was taken prisoner, but escaped shortly afterwards. He infiltrated the nuptials, dressed as the priest, and was challenged to a final game of combat chess by Simon. If Ross won, he could have Beatrice. </p>

<p>Ross lost, of course, and realized that he had become the villain of the story. The hero always wins, and Beatrice and Simon exchanged vows.</p>
