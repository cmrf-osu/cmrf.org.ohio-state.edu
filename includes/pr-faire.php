<p>During the <?php echo $fair_year;?> Faire, CMRF will distribute Faire programs containing information about the performers and shows at Faire. The <?php echo $fair_year_old;?> Faire coincided with <a href="http://parent.osu.edu/programs/sibs_and_kids_weekend">Sibs and Kids Weekend</a>. More than three thousand students and their families visited Faire and received Faire programs.</p>
<p>Every year, CMRF opens the program to advertisers. Any greyscale graphic can be printed in the program, up to 5.5 inches wide and 8 inches tall.</p>
<p>If you would like to advertise in the <?php echo $fair_year;?> program, contact our <a href="contact.php">advertising coordinator</a> for more information.</p>
